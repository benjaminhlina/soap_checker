Description: Soapcheckr allows users to easily check if the boundary 
        used and supplied will work when using a soap-film smoother for 
        Generalized Addtive Models (GAMs) supported by the package {mgcv}. 
        The package also allows for users to assess if the knots and data points 
        they want to supply the GAM will fit within the boundary.
